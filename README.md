=======
Create button has been added and implemented. There is also a refactor to store data inside the database table.

After pulling the git, make sure to perform cds deploy --to sqlite:db/ai2code-database.sqlite to create the database.

Once that is done, you can test out the create button. The name and description can be merely string, but the typeID must be a UUID. Here are several UUIDs that can be used to test it out.

There will be some changes in the future, such as using custom fragment to get the TaskType instead of relying on manual UUID input.
